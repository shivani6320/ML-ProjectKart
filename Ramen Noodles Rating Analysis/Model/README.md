# Ramen Noodles Rating Analysis
Ramen (/ˈrɑːmən/) (拉麺, ラーメン, rāmen, Japanese pronunciation: [ɾaꜜːmeɴ]) (literally: "pulled noodles") is a Japanese noodle soup. It consists of Chinese-style wheat noodles served in a meat or (occasionally) fish-based broth, often flavored with soy sauce or miso, and uses toppings such as sliced pork (叉焼, chāshū), nori (dried seaweed), menma, and scallions. Nearly every region in Japan has its own variation of ramen, such as the tonkotsu (pork bone broth) ramen of Kyushu and the miso ramen of Hokkaido. Mazemen is a ramen dish that is not served in a soup, but rather with a sauce (such as tare).

## Conclusion and Discussion
Let's conclude the whole session of work by the following bulletines -
1. Ramen is very popular and highly preferred in Asian countries like Japan,China,South korea etc. Exceptions are USA and UK. We can say that migration of people from Asian countries to USA and UK is high and that has resulted in high Ramen Consumption in those 2 countries.
2. We see "Nissin" brand to be having the highest number of varities followed by "Nongshim" and "Maruchan" .
3. "Pack" Style is most preferred with 59.6% and followed by "Bowl" and "Cup"(~18% each)
4. The plot of density of "Stars" shows that it is "Left Skewed". which means that the ratings are almost near about 4 and 5 everytime!
5. In Japan **Nissin** is the most upvoted one!
6. But **Nongshim** has more five stars than any other brands.
7. **Paldo** having very good ratings against the Nongshim and Samyang.

That's all from this analysis of the Ramen Noodles. See you in next project!
