PROJECT TITLE : Reddit Tweets Prediction

GOAL : To predict about the different reddit tweets in detail.

DATASET : https://www.kaggle.com/youben/tweets-sentiment-analysis

WHAT I HAD DONE : In this project first I first performed a exploratory data analysis on the given dataset which includes of data cleaning , data manipulation, data preprocessing , data visualization and after that we used NLP for the stopwords removal and cleaning, after using NLP we did the model building using different machine learning classification and regression algorithms and then predicted the accuracy of every model . In the model prediction part we used different machine learning algorithms . In each algorithm I had included the accuracy score , training score , confusion matrix, classification report . While in the EDA part I have included different plots for the different visualizations of our dataset .Some plots which we used for visualizing the dataset are Histogram , Barplot , Boxplot, Heatmap , Scatter plot , Pairplot , Jointplot etc.



ACCURACIES OF DIFFERENT MODELS ARE:

Logistic Regression= 83.70 %

Decision Tree Classifier= 58 %

Naiye Bayes= 88 %

Ada Boost Classifier = 68 %

LIBRARIES:

PANDAS

NUMPY

MATPLOTLIB

SEABORN

SCIPY

SKLEARN

Keras

Tensorflow

Nltk

CONCLUSION :


From executing all the algorithms , Naive Bayes got a training accuracy of 88% , then logistic regression with 84% training accuracy score which is quite well for the given dataset

The accuracy of other models can be increased further by HyperTuning.
