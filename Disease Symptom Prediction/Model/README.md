**Disease Symptom Prediction**

**GOAL**

The goal of this project is predict symptom of disease using the information contained in this dataset.

**DATASET**

Dataset can be downloaded from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/itachi9604/disease-symptom-description-dataset).

**WHAT I HAD DONE**
- Step 1: Data Exploration
- Step 2: Data Preparation
- Step 3: Data visualization
- Step 4: Data Training
- Step 5: Model Creation
- Step 6: Performance Evaluation


**MODELS USED**
- Linear Regression
- Ridge Regression
- K Neighbors Classifier
- Lasso Regression
- Random Forest Classifier
- Decision Tree Classifier
- XGBoost Classifier


**LIBRARIES NEEDED**
- warnings
- nltk
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- sklearn (For data traning, importing models and performance check)


**CONCLUSION**
- By using Linear Regression model 
 ```python
    Accuracy achieved :  25.65
 ``` 
- By using Ridge Regression model 
 ```python
    Accuracy achieved :  25.65
 ``` 
- By using K Neighbors Classifier model 
 ```python
    Accuracy achieved :  39.29
 ``` 
- By using Lasso Regression model 
 ```python
    Accuracy achieved :  25.55
 ``` 
- By using Random Forest Classifier model 
 ```python
    Accuracy achieved :  91.84
 ``` 
- By using Decision Tree Classifier model 
 ```python
    Accuracy achieved :  81.63
 ``` 
 - By using XGBoost Classifier model 
 ```python
    Accuracy achieved :  89.80
 ``` 
**Conclusion:**
- ccuracy of Regression models- Linear regression, rigde regression, Lasso Regression is almost same around 25%.

- Accuracy of K Neighbors Classifier is 39.29%.

- Whereas accuracy of Random Forest Classifier , Decision Tree Classifier and XG Boost Classifierr is significant.

- And the Accuracy of the Random Forest Classifier is more, so it is efficient among all.
